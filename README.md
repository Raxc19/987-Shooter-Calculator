# 987-Shooter-Calculator
This project models a shooter system to calculate pulley sizes, belt lengths, and motor voltage based on shaft spacing and target distance. It accounts for compression angle, contact time, and system drag to predict required wheel speed and ensure consistent, repeatable shots.
